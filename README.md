# Organizer's Notes
Currently, there is no form of organization. The descriptions should be an **accurate** and **efficient** indicator of the site's purpose for searching purposes. Last updated `2019-11-16`.

## Adding a Website
1. Fork this repo.
2. Commit and push with your changes.
   1. Make sure that formatting is consistent with existing table. If it isn't, your pull request will be rejected.
   2. Make sure that your description is **accurate** and **efficient**. If I was looking to do something where your proposed website would be useful, the description would contain certain key terms that I would search first. A concise clarified version of the website's own tagline is usually successful.
3. Make a pull request in this repo.
